At times we need to fetch some data from our GitHub like details about the pull requests to some of our repositories in an open source program.

Larger the data, the more cumbersome it becomes to fetch, analyze and derive the desired inference

What if we could automate it?

Well, using a simple python script with a GraphQL⚛ query can save the day for us!

- Have Anaconda installed in your operating system and set to path.

- Clone or download this repository

- Open the Terminal

- Move inside the your cloned copy of the repo

`cd GitKundli`

- Now make sure you have all the dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Time to run our app

`streamlit run app.py`

- Open `http://localhost:8502` or the link displayed in the terminal where the streamlit app is running on your local server

- Visit this [link](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and Click on `Generate new token`

- Initially select all the options. [ Note: Later on you can come back, delete this token and generate a new one with only the permissions you think are necessary]

- Don't forget to give a name to the token ( say `gitkundli` )

- Copy the alphanumeric value of the taken [and save it in a text file for future reference. Remember you can only access this once on GitHub]
- Return back your hosted app

- Open Specific Pages, Give the Token, Some related Information, Make use of the output!

- Now let's run our script and store our results in a csv file `python gitkundli.py`
